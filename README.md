  On 28 February 2018, 57 mm of precipitation associated with a warm conveyor belt (WCB) fell within 21 h over South Korea. To investigate how the large-scale circulation influenced the microphysics of this intense precipitation event, we used radar measurements, snowflake photographs and radiosounding data from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (ICE-POP 2018). The WCB was identified with trajectories computed with analysis wind fields from the Integrated Forecast System global atmospheric model. The WCB was collocated with a zone of enhanced wind speed of up to 45 m s−1 at 6500 m a.s.l., as measured by a radiosonde and a Doppler radar. Supercooled liquid water (SLW) with concentrations exceeding 0.2 g kg−1 was produced during the rapid ascent within the WCB. During the most intense precipitation period, vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables show a peak and subsequent decrease in differential reflectivity as aggregation starts. Below the peak in differential reflectivity, the specific differential phase shift continues to increase, indicating early riming of oblate crystals and secondary ice generation. We hypothesise that the SLW produced in the WCB led to intense riming. Moreover, embedded updraughts in the WCB and turbulence at its lower boundary enhanced aggregation by increasing the probability of collisions between particles. This suggests that both aggregation and riming occurred prominently in this WCB. This case study shows how the large-scale atmospheric flow of a WCB provides ideal conditions for rapid precipitation growth involving SLW production, riming and aggregation. Future microphysical studies should also investigate the synoptic conditions to understand how observed processes in clouds are related to large-scale circulation.

  This study evaluates the performance of several cloud microphysics parameterizations in simulating surface precipitation for two snowstorm cases during the International Collaborative Experiment held at the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics and Winter Paralympic Games (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign. We compared four different schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, namely the double-moment 6-class (WDM6), the WRF single-moment 6-class (WSM6), and Thompson and Morrison parameterizations. Both WSM6 and WDM6 overestimated the precipitation amount for the shallow precipitation system because of the substantial amount of cloud ice, mostly generated by the deposition process. The simulated precipitation amount and distribution for the deep precipitation system showed no noticeable differences in the different cloud microphysics parameterizations. However, the simulated hydrometeor type at the surface using WSM6 and WDM6 showed good agreement with observations for all cases. The accuracy of the mean mass-weighted terminal velocity of cloud ice VI¯ applied in WSM6 and WDM6 is ±20%. The number concentration of cloud ice and the ice microphysics processes are newly retrieved with 1.2 times increased VI⁠¯. For the shallow snowstorm, the precipitation amount was reduced by approximately 8% because of the inefficient deposition and its effects on the subsequent ice microphysical processes, such as the accretion of cloud ice by snow and the conversion from cloud ice to snow.

  The standard method used in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for distributing MPI processes across the processors is not always optimal. This circumstance affects performance, i.e., execution times, but also energy consumption, especially if the application is to be extended to exascale. The authors found that the reason why the standard method for process distribution is not always optimal was an imbalance between the orthogonality of the communication and the proper cache usage, and this affects energy consumption. We present an improved MPI process distribution algorithm that increases the performance. Furthermore, scalability analyses for the new algorithm are presented and the energy use of the system is evaluated. A solution for balancing energy use with performance is also proposed for cases where the former is a concern.

  Weather forecasting, especially snowfall prediction, was critical in the 2018 Winter Olympics, where the accuracy of the predictions was of key importance for the planning of the different Olympic events. It was a significant challenge for the authors to meet the requirements in time and forecast resolution, while doing their best to be as competitive as possible. All the forecasts were obtained using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, executed on the GALGO supercomputer. In order to obtain the best performance and meet the required execution times, different combinations of compilers, Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries and computing platforms were tested to seek the best combinations. This work proposes an empirical score of special interest to supercomputer maintainers, developers and scientists, which can be useful to obtain the best WRF configuration for their systems. Additionally, we found substantial performance differences when using different combinations of compilers, MPI libraries and hybrid shared memory paradigms, although these differences varied depending on the underlying platform. As conclusion, after all the tests we performed, we chose the combination with Intel compilers, Intel MPI library and OpenMP for the production system tasked to perform the weather forecasts for the Winter Olympic Games.

  Snow particle size distribution (PSD) information is important in understanding the microphysics and quantitative precipitation estimation over complex terrain. Measurement and interpretation of the snow PSDs is a topic of active research. This study investigates snow PSDs during 3 year of observations from Parsivel2 disdrometers and precipitation imaging packages (PIP) at five different sites in the PyeongChang region of South Korea. Variabilities in the values of the density of snow (ρ), snowfall rate (S), and ice water content (IWC) are studied. To further understand the characteristics of snow PSD at different density and snowfall rate, the snow particle size distribution measurements are divided into six classes based on the density values of snowfall and five classes based on snowfall rates. The mean shape factors (Dm, log10Nw, and μ) of normalized gamma distribution are also derived based on different density and snowfall rate classes. The Dm decreases and log10Nw and μ increase as the density increases. The Dm and log10Nw increase and μ decreases with the increase of snowfall rate. The power-law relationship between ρ and Dm is obtained and the relationship between S and IWC is also derived.

  Accurate estimation of snowfall rate during snowstorms is crucial. This estimate directly impacts the hydrological and atmospheric models. The density of snow plays a very important role in estimating the snowfall rate. In this paper, the density of snow is investigated during a huge snowstorm event during the International Collaborative Experiment held during the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018). The density is calculated using the terminal velocities and diameters of the snow particles measured by a disdrometer. In this study, we not only use radar reflectivity factor (Z) for snowfall rate (S) estimation, but also use dual-frequency ratio (DFR). We derive S-Z and S-Z-DFR relations for snowfall estimation during this snowstorm event after considering the density of snow. The comparisons are performed between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Dual-frequency Dual-polarization Doppler Radar (D3R) and precipitation gauges using these two power-law relations. The results show that the two relations for snowfall rate estimation agree well with gauges, but the S-Z-DFR method performs the best, which has a lower normalized standard error. The error in the snowfall rate estimates decreases as the time scale becomes large. This shows that the S-Z-DFR algorithm is a promising way for snowfall quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) and can be used as a ground validation tool for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) snowfall production evaluations.

  The 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in Pyeongchang, Korea, during February and March. We examined the near surface winds and wind gusts along the sloping surface at two outdoor venues in Pyeongchang during February and March using surface wind data. The outdoor venues are located in a complex, mountainous terrain, and hence the near-surface winds form intricate patterns due to the interplay between large-scale and locally forced winds. During February and March, the dominant wind at the ridge level is westerly; however, a significant wind direction change is observed along the sloping surface at the venues. The winds on the sloping surface are also influenced by thermal forcing, showing increased upslope flow during daytime. When neutral air flows over the hill, the windward and leeward flows show a significantly different behavior. A higher correlation of the wind speed between upper- and lower-level stations is shown in the windward region compared with the leeward region. The strong synoptic wind, small width of the ridge, and steep leeward ridge slope angle provide favorable conditions for flow separation at the leeward foot of the ridge. The gust factor increases with decreasing surface elevation and is larger during daytime than nighttime. A significantly large gust factor is also observed in the leeward region.
